This repository addresses the forecasting problem of Monthly production of chocolate confectionery in Australia: tonnes. July 1957 â€“ Aug 1995. 
To this end, a seasonal auto regressive integrated moving average (Seasonal ARIMA) model is developed in python by using "Statsmodels" library. 
To pick the model parameters, a hyperparameter tuning approach is presented by using "Pyramid". 
The accuracy of the proposed model is further validated using a cross-validation strategy.
